# Welcome to Chirp Final Practical Test! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this blue twitter-like page and get it looking as **close** to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. Remember, you can always go and check previous design challenges in the course and use the CSS learned for this and future challenges.

### Mandatory

-   You must follow BEM: [BEM class naming convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) or checkout this [this article](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

-   Use CSS variables: [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
-   You must orginize your CSS (using external stylesheets)

-   You should make use of Flexbox and all its properties

-   You must start, whenever possible, using [REM units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) units for specifying, widths, heights, fonts, etc. This improves the accessibility of your website. Check more about [Accessible responsive design](https://web.dev/accessible-responsive-design/)

-   Your document has to be semantic, check [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) (divs are ok just for styling purposes)

-   Organize your project (folders structure, naming, etc.)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a desktop and a tablet version of the design. Using just flexbox, we can make the design also for tablets.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

## No Style Guide

The content should be centered as previous group design challenges:
Desktop: Max-width 1440px

Research skills are **really** important as developers:

> 1. You are in charge of finding a way to get the **hexidecimal** colors of the design and orginizing them in CSS variables.
>    Some Google Search Tips: get hexidecimal color, hexidecimal color image, image hexidecimal color, etc.
> 2. Find a way to insert emojis. Can you increase the size of these emojis using CSS?
