    Every Design Challenge will have this index.html file that you are reading. Also, when you downloaded this week's challenge folder
    and open it as a project here in Visual Studio Code, you should see in the "explorer" tab, which is the left pane, one file: index.html (this file), one folder: "images" (it contains all te graphics you need for the challenge) 
    and another folder: designImages (this folder just includes the images you have to create in your own browser)
