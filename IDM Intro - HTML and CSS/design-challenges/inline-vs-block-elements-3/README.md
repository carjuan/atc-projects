# Third Week Challenges

This week challenges are about getting confortable with using `<div>` as generic elements for groupings things on page. Also, understanding inline and block level elements and how they behave on a web page.

By building simple navbars, country flags and box prices, students will gain some experience in understanding these fundamental concepts when building websites. Although, not the best practices of today (flexbox, grid, semantic HTML, etc.) I think these challenges can solidify crucial concepts moving forward.
