        <!-- 
        Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a desktop and a mobile version of the design. Using just flexbox, we can make the design also for mobile.
        The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.
        There is **no** required assets for this challenge (images, icons, logos, etc)
