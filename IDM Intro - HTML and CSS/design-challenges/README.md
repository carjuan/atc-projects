# Design Challenges

## Purpose

These Challeges work as "mini-steps" and key learning outcomes to help to build the bigger end of the week project.

> From week-one to week-four, design challenges should be instructions in OneNote > \_Content Library -> IDM Intro - HTML and CSS > Design Challenges > Week's design challenge

> **Starting from Flexbox Design Challenges Hero Section**, starter files will include a README.md file and style-guide.md for any colors, fonts, etc. Moving forward, the starter files for design challenges will be composed of images and design folder, README.md, style-guide.md and index.html.
