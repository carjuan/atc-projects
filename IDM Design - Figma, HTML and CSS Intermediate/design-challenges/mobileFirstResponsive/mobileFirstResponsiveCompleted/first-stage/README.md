# First Stage - While coding at 320px

## No flexbox at this stage

## No max-widths

-   In this stage students will only start coding on screen sizes of 320px

-   All images are responsive as screen size changes

-   Since img is set to 100% width and height auto, they will grow and shrink as the browser
    shrinks or grows

-   To remove the behaviour of images growing too much, students should start setting a max-width in rem units on
    the parent container

-   should start adding media queries "min-width"
    and set max-wdith of rem on a parent container of the image so that the 100% width
    set on the image will always be based on the parent container and not the whole page

-   Just with core.css and having a basic setup of css, students should get to the
    first stage without adding too much on the main.css
