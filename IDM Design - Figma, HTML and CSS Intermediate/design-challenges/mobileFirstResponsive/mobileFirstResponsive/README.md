# Welcome to Mobile First Responsive Design Challenge âœ‹

## The challenge

- Your challenge is to build out a simple but very responsive webpage located in the **design/** folder

- This challenge is going to be built in small steps or "stages" so we can learn the fundamentals first

**NOTE: FLEXBOX IS NOT ALLOWED IN THE FOOTER SECTION AT ANY GIVEN SCREEN SIZE**
**NOTE: FOR EACH STAGE FINISHED, LET YOUR TEACHER KNOW BEFORE MOVING TO NEXT STAGE**

## FIRST STAGE

1.  Take a look at the design folder for **first-stage**

2.  Only code while having Firefox Developers Tools open and in responsive mode at **320px**

3.  Flexbox is not **allowed** at any point in this **first-stage** 

4.  No **max-widths** are used

5.  All images are responsive as screen size changes 

6.  Just with core.css, you should get to the
    first stage without adding too much on the styles.css

## SECOND STAGE

1.  Take a look at the design folder for **second-stage**

2.  Only code while having Firefox Developers Tools open and in responsive mode at **600px** or more

3.  Price plans images should be rounded now and do not grow too much when screen sizes changes

4.  Remember to think about the performance of the website, the less modification you do to an image, the better (think about masking elements)

5.  Background colors are now changing as you change the color of the html element in Firefox Developer Tools
    
6.  At 600px or more, "Choose your plan" heading and a second "Business link" should appear in footer

7.  "buy this plan" are now buttons

8.  Buy links now have a border-radius of 5px and should have the same border colors
    as the images.

9.  "buy this plan" button should have a hand cursor effect

## LAST-STAGE

1.  Take a look at the design folder for **second-stage**

2.  Images should be fully responsive

3.  You are using overflow to mask images and create rounded corners

4.  Pricing plans are in a row on 940px screen size or more

5. Header, Main and Footer max-width should be 1200px

2. min-width: 600px

3. min-width: 940px

4. min-width: 1200px
