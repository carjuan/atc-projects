# Finsweet - Design Challenge

## Welcome to this week's long challenge! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out the Finsweet Mockup pages and get it looking as **close** to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. Remember, you can always go and check previous design challenges in the course and use the CSS learned for this and future challenges.

### Mandatory

-   From now on, your projects should follow BEM: [BEM class naming convention](https://getbem.com/naming/) or checkout this [this article](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/)

-   Use CSS variables: [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)
-   You must orginize your CSS (using external stylesheets)

-   You should make use of Flexbox and all its properties

-   You must start, whenever possible, using [REM units](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_units.asp) units for specifying, widths, heights, fonts, etc. This improves the accessibility of your website. Check more about [Accessible responsive design](https://web.dev/accessible-responsive-design/)

-   Your document has to be semantic, check [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html) (divs are ok just for styling purposes)

```html
You MUST use all these tags to complete the challenge. You can use any other tag, but the following tags need to be in
your HTML
<!-- <link>, <header>, <nav>, <div>, <img>, <button>, <a>, <span>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <ul>, <li> -->
```

## Guidelines

-   Start writing your base styles that you know are going to be the same for all pages (links, buttons, \*, li, body, button: hover)

    -   This file should be named core.css

-   Check style-guide.jpg and start writing your CSS variables (font-face, font property, colors)

    -   This file should be named theme.css

-   Then start with index.html and main.css for the homepage

-   Start writing your HTML markup first (semantic HTML)

-   Then, start assigning names (BEM) before you even start styling

-   Once a full section of your HTML markup is finished, then start styling

## IMPORTANT:

Do not move to another section of a webpage if:

-   CSS variables are not working for you (figure that out first)

-   Your result is not the same as the design presented

## CSS you might need

-   box-shadow: inset
-   background-image
-   background-position
-   transform: scale()

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder.

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`.

There is also a `style-guide.jpg` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Building your project

1. Look through the design to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
2. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. **Writing your HTML first** can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content and SEMANTIC HTML.
3. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
4. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
5. Remember to start using external stylesheets with the `link` element. Create a folder called CSS in the root of your project.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
